When invoked interactively without a prefix argument and no active
region, mark moves to beginning of line.
When invoked interactively without a prefix argument, and region is
active, mark moves one line away of point (i.e., forward if mark is at
or after point, back if mark is before point), thus extending the region
by one line.  Since the direction of region extension depends on the
relative position of mark and point, you can change the direction by
\\[exchange-point-and-mark]."
